9:43-9:50		try use linux readimx - remove internal addpaths - get invalid mex file error
11:10 - 12:30	try to fix readimx problem in linux. Start working on being able to load old masksing file and being able to edit it
				found error in display operations where old masks are visible if cropping
				found a way to edit the masks loaded from a GUI output file (created function MHData_edit_masks)-
15:24 - 15:54	implementing method to edit old masks for DIC data & DVC data
17:00 - 18:11	continue implementing method to edit old masks for DVC
				slider does not work for old mask files for DVC data
				for DVC opens a new instance of GUI that cant use any of its callbacks/menu drop downs

02/02/2017	
15:33 - 18:02	Continue to work on getting DVC data to work when importing created mask files
				Determined issue - roi is not being passed from the callback that loads the old mask file to the other callbacks
				Fixed issue of saving the slider and its textbox in procdata - was causing DVC data loaded from an old mask file to create a new image
				DVC now importing correctly but slider has more increments than there are rows/columns
				fixed slider increment issue using SliderStep option
				Ensure that the slider can only have whole number values by flooring the value input and setting that as the new slider value

03/02/2017
07:56 - 11:23	Start writing down what tasks should be completed and which features should be added
				getting readimx.mexa64 file to work in linux - not working yet 30 min
				add a string box under the slider for DVC data that shows which column is being viewed out of the number of columbs that exist
				fix MHGraph_Zheight.. so that they update the textboxes under the slider
				add tooltipstrings to these textboxes and align the textboxes
				update textboxes when change height using gui menu instead of slider
				5 min Lucas showed me how to use the 3D printer
				10 min break
				add function MHData_close_field to output a file containing the processed displacement fields
				make the load mask function more robust so an error does not result if a file is not selected
				do the same for all the data loading functions

05/02/2017
10:41 - 13:50	Figuring out how to use hatchfill2 to hatch rectangles and polygons
				Use contour with hatchfill2 to hatch data in function MHOptions_hatch
				Figure out how to apply hatch but still display displacement data as it would usually look (contourf changes colours of displacement data) - working for DIC

14:37 - 15:41	Change MHOptions_hatch to work with DVC data
				found out matrices displayed for DVC data must be rotated when not on the PosX and PosY orientation

06/02/2017
use todays save copy if want before switch Z on axes
11:40 - 13:00	fixing matrix not displayed on correct axes
13:50 - 14:10	change posZ from y axis to x axis since data is in that form

31/03/2017
8:00-13:00		adjust code so that it outputs variables consisten with matts format. put subfunctions in a folder.
				create an example code to show how to create masks without using gui.

28/04/2017
7:00-8:30		add function 'output_other_fields' to field_format so that other fields such as the correlation coefficient can
				be output to the final structure variable obtained from field_format.



05/08/2017
12:00 - 13:30	Find issues with displaying DVC data
				Apply squeeze when reducing the 3D matrices to 2D matrices in order to display DVC data
				Add "set(gca,'YDir','normal');" after "imagesc" in update_figure function so that y axis is the correct direction
				Fix update_fiugre to display DVC data. Correct orientation now but axes of data are wrong
3:40 - 4:20		Create a text file of all the functions and what they do - and think how to change the way the DVC data is stored
				in the GUI so that it is possible to display the data using the correct data on the axes.

07/08/2017
10:40 - 11:40	Changing the imported DVC data format - create "Correct_DVC_data" and edit "update_figure" & "MHData_type_DVC"

08/08/2017
12:15 - 13:30	Changed all the functions (in Convention_Code) that interact with DVC data to use the correct data for displaying purposes and the the
				correct data displayed on the x and y axes.

09/08/2017
13:10 - 14:50	Check that the changes made to Convention_Code with regards to the DVC data's new format work.
				Change display_operations to display DVC data in the same way.
				Find working readimx for windows (the version in "old readimx" folder works)
18:15 - 18:50	Researching Matlab apps

10/08/2017
13:00 - 14:30	Ensure the Convention_Code is working properly for DVC data
				Change field_format to work with new corrected DVC data display format - since masks are determined within field_format using imagesc
16:40 - 19:30	Check that changes made to field format work
				Fix display_operations ref points correction function so that it works with DVC data
				Fix general issues found during testing.

11/08/2017
11:50 - 12:45	Adding sliders to display_operations for DVC data.
				(Created the slider callbacks for the xy, xz and yz planes)
14:40 - 15:00	Finish changing display_operations to work with DVC data with sliders for the heights.
17:00 - 21:25	Checking that field_format processes DVC data correctly
				Found issue with field_format way of dealing with masks and fixed
				Fixing issue with cropping of DVC data in field_format
				20 min break
				Fixing issues with cropping of DVC data in display_operations

14/08/2017
12:15 - 13:00	Fix issues with cropping DVC data in display_operations

Notes:
rot90(fliplr(a),1)


impoint done twice in update_figure

issue with hatching - number of indices for DVC data does not match - data matrices displayed incorrectly for dvc data - must be rotated

Becker (22/03/2017):
comment each section
get working as soon as possible
all supporting functions in a folder (link to matlab so it knows where it is)
seperate supporting functions into own scripts
make example so people understand how to use code (and example how to do through script only)
create example code to illustrate how to use backend and create masks manually and publish it. can put pictures into publishing



ISSUES:
If select a roi type then select another without putting the first down then they are both put down a the same time. Also first ones options are different for DVC data.
When setting mask range for DVC convert whole numbers to height that will actually result and display for user.
If a crop is applied that removed data which would have been masked (or had another function applied to it) the program needs to be able to handle it




Display_operations needs a slider to set the heights for the axes == done
Display_operations - masks are shifted if ref point is applied. == fixed
Display_operations - masks range possibly not correct if ref point applied == not true - masks are independent of POS matrices.
